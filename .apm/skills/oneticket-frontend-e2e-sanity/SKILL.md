# Frontend E2E Sanity

## Objective

Provide a **lightweight end-to-end sanity check** for the frontend so that the agent can:

- open the running application in a real browser (via Playwright),
- capture browser console errors (including Service Worker/MSW issues),
- and fail fast if critical client-side errors occur, even when build and unit/smoke tests pass.

This skill complements build checks and unit tests by adding a **real-browser smoke test** focused on page load and console errors only — not a full E2E test suite.

---

## When to Use

Use this skill when:

- the project includes a web frontend, and
- the agent needs to validate that the application:
  - loads without hard errors in the browser (no blank screen due to runtime JS errors), and
  - does not emit critical console errors on initial load.

---

## Principle

The E2E smoke test must:

1. **Serve the built app** using the project's preview/serve command.
2. **Open the app** in a headless Chromium browser via Playwright.
3. **Listen for critical errors** on the browser console and page error events.
4. **Fail** if any critical pattern is detected; **pass** otherwise.

Critical patterns to detect:

- `Failed to register the Service Worker`
- `Uncaught`
- `Unexpected token`
- `is not valid JSON`
- `404 (Not Found)`

---

## Implementation

The agent must:

1. Identify the build and preview commands from `architecture.md` or `package.json`.
2. Install Playwright locally inside the project (not globally).
3. Install the Chromium browser via Playwright's install command.
4. Create a minimal smoke script that follows the principle above.
5. Run the script after every significant frontend change, alongside the build and unit tests.

---

## Graceful fallback

If the environment does not allow installing Playwright (unavailable runtime, non-writable cache, timeout risk, etc.):

- Consider E2E as **not executed** for this iteration.
- Do NOT block the session — continue with build and unit test validation.
- Clearly document in the response why E2E was not run and which commands the maintainer must run locally to activate it.

**Never let a Playwright installation attempt block or timeout the agent session.**
